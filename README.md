This repository provides a simple API to query, store and manipulate 
available data for investment funds in Brazil.

All data is sourced from the Brazilian regulator's (CVM) official
[website](http://dados.cvm.gov.br/dataset/fi-doc-inf_diario) and can be updated daily.

This is **not** an official API and I am not affiliated to the regulator by any means.
